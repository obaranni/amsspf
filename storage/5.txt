Sets the option to create a new file, failing if it already exists.

No file is allowed to exist at the target location, also no (dangling) symlink. In this way, if the call succeeds, the file returned is guaranteed to be new.

This option is useful because it is atomic. Otherwise between checking whether a file exists and creating a new one, the file may have been created by another process (a TOCTOU race condition / attack).

If .create_new(true) is set, .create() and .truncate() are ignored.

The file must be opened with write or append access in order to create a new file.
